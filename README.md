# Randomizer_AndroidApp
A simple app made with Kotlin

These Days there are many choices to choose from whenever you're shopping or doing anything
so this app makes you specify how many choices do you have and select a random choice for you.
I made this app as a part of learning Kotlin process, which is similar to java to a great extend.
